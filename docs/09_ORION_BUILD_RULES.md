# ORION — BUILD RULES

Version: 1.0
Status: Canonical

## 1. Language

JavaScript and JSX only.

No Python.

No TypeScript unless the user explicitly changes this rule later.

## 2. Stack

- Next.js
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MUI
- SQLite
- Markdown/filesystem

## 3. Model

Nemotron is a replaceable provider.

OpenClaw is not ORION.

Open WebUI is not ORION.

## 4. Naming

Use names that explain the job.

Good:

```text
findRelevantContext
createProposal
approveProposal
executeApprovedAction
verifyResult
```

Avoid unclear names like:

```text
hydrateCtxGraph
runStage7
mutateV2
```

## 5. Errors

Every external operation can fail.

Handle:

- network errors
- database errors
- model errors
- filesystem errors
- permission errors
- timeout
- conflicts

Do not hide them.

## 6. API validation

Treat all browser input as untrusted.

Validate:

- IDs
- strings
- paths
- limits
- enum values
- object shapes

## 7. Business logic

Do not put core business logic inside React pages.

The UI displays and requests.

The backend decides and performs.

## 8. Model output

Never do:

```javascript
await fs.writeFile(modelOutput.path, modelOutput.content);
```

Instead:

```text
model
→ structured intent
→ proposal
→ approval
→ execution
```

## 9. Tests

Every new important behavior needs tests.

At minimum:

- success
- bad input
- permission/security failure
- important edge case

## 10. UI

Every important screen needs:

- loading
- empty
- error
- success
- approval state where relevant

## 11. Dependencies

Before adding a package, ask:

- why is it needed?
- is existing code enough?
- is it maintained?
- is the license acceptable?
- can the project avoid it?

## 12. Free-first

Prefer:

1. open source
2. free
3. self-hostable
4. replaceable
5. maintained

Paid services may be optional adapters.

## 13. Database

Start with SQLite.

Do not add another database until a real measured need exists.

## 14. Queue

Start with a SQLite-backed queue.

Do not add Redis or distributed infrastructure without a demonstrated reason.

## 15. Git

Use checkpoints before large changes.

Do not destroy valuable history.

## 16. Phase discipline

Implement only the current phase.

Do not sneak later features into the current phase because they seem easy.

## 17. Completion

A feature is complete only when:

- behavior works
- errors are handled
- tests exist
- documentation is accurate
- old conflicting behavior is removed
- no placeholder is hiding unfinished work

## 18. Stop rule

Stop and report when:

- a security decision is unclear
- a migration could lose data
- a required dependency is missing
- the phase depends on an unbuilt later phase

Do not invent a fake solution just to keep going.
